/**
 * A React hook that creates a stable event callback that automatically captures the latest props and state.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Returns a stable function reference that remains identical between renders
 * - Eliminates the need for dependency arrays (unlike useCallback)
 * - Always captures the latest props/state values when the callback is invoked
 * - Safely handles Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
 *
 * @template TCallback - The type of the callback function
 * @param callback - The event callback function to stabilize
 * @returns A stable version of the callback that always accesses the latest props/state
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * function MyComponent({ value }: { value: string }) {
 *   const handleClick = useEvent((e: MouseEvent) => {
 *     // `value` will always be current, no dependency array needed
 *     console.log('Clicked with value:', value);
 *   });
 *
 *   return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * This hook is particularly useful for:
 * - Event handlers that need access to current props/state
 * - Callbacks passed to child components where you want to avoid unnecessary re-renders
 * - Situations where useCallback's dependency array becomes unwieldy
 *
 * @throws {Error} If the callback is invoked during initial render (before mount)
